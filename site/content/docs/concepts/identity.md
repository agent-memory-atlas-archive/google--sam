Every participant in a mesh, node or router, has a key that it generated
itself and a credential that the control plane issued for that key. This page
follows the credential from enrollment to expiry: how a node gets it, what it
contains, how it is renewed, and how it is revoked.

## Keys and peer IDs

The first thing a node does is generate an Ed25519 key pair and store it in
its data directory (`~/.config/sam-mesh/agent.db` by default). Its **peer
ID**, the `12D3KooW...` string that appears in logs, discovery results and
proxy URLs, is derived from the public key. The key never leaves the machine.
The credential is bound to the key, so a copied credential is useless without
it, and every peer-to-peer connection proves possession of the key as part
of the libp2p handshake.

`sam-node reset --all` deletes the key and gives the node a new peer ID.
`sam-node reset` without `--all` keeps the key and deletes only the
credential.

## Enrollment

Enrollment is a request to the control plane: "here is my public key, here is
who I am, please issue me a credential for role *X* with labels *Y*". There
are three ways to say who you are.

**Interactive OIDC login.** `sam-node join <control-plane-url>` fetches the
control plane's `/info`, learns which identity provider it trusts, and runs an
OpenID Connect login. If a browser is available, it uses the loopback flow.
On a headless machine it uses the device flow (a URL and a code that you enter
on another device), or falls back to pasting a code. `--auth-mode` selects
one of these explicitly. The ID token from the login is sent to
`POST /register` together with the public key and a signature over a fresh
challenge. This is how a person enrolls a laptop.

**Non-interactive OIDC.** A workload that already has an OIDC token does not
need a login. `sam-node run --jwt-path <file>` enrolls with the token in that
file. On Kubernetes this is a projected service account token with the
audience the control plane expects. `--client-id` and `--client-secret-path`
do the same with an OAuth client-credentials grant. Routers enroll in the
same way with `sam-router --jwt-path`.

**Bootstrap token.** An operator mints a token with the admin API, the
console, or `sam-one token create`, and copies it to the machine. The node
sends it to `POST /enroll`. Unless the control plane runs with
`--auto-approve-enrollment`, the request waits in a queue until an
administrator approves it, and the node polls `GET /enroll/status` while it
waits. A token has a role, an expiry and a usage count. A single-use token is
spent as soon as one node is approved with it. This is how machines without
an identity of their own enroll, and how `sam-one` enrolls devices by QR
code.

For all three paths, the control plane checks the same things before it
mints a credential:

1. The peer ID matches the submitted public key, and the challenge signature
   verifies under that key. This proves that the requester holds the key it
   is registering.
2. Neither the peer ID nor the identity behind it is banned.
3. The identity resolves, through the bindings in the mesh policy, to the
   role being requested. `sam-node` requests `sam:role:node`, `sam-router`
   requests `sam:role:router`, and `sam-box` requests `sam:role:sambox`. If
   the policy binds nobody to `sam:role:node`, no node can enroll.
4. Every label the node declared is permitted by the `allowed_labels` of a
   role it holds. A role without `allowed_labels` permits no labels.

The node stores the credential, the control plane's public key, the control
plane URL and the router addresses it received. From then on it is a member
of that mesh only. If you point it at a different control plane later, it
refuses until you reset it, because a credential is only valid for the mesh
that issued it.

## The credential

The credential is a [Biscuit](https://www.biscuitsec.org/), a signed
authorization token. Its authority block holds facts written in Datalog, a
small logic language in which a fact looks like `role("sam:role:node")`. The
block is signed by the control plane's Ed25519 key. Any node with the public
key can verify it without contacting anyone. The block contains:

| Fact | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `node("12D3KooW...")`, `client_peer_id("12D3KooW...")` | The peer ID the token belongs to. Every verifier checks that the connection it arrived on was authenticated as this peer. |
| `expiration(<time>)` | When the token stops being valid. |
| `role("sam:role:node")`, `role("developer")` | The roles the identity resolved to, one fact each. |
| `user("...")`, `email("...")`, `group("...")`, `idp_role("...")` | Claims copied from the OIDC token: subject, verified email, each group, each entry of the issuer's `roles` claim. Absent for bootstrap enrollments. |
| `label("region", "eu")` | One fact per declared and permitted label. |
| `granted_service_*`, `granted_target_*`, `granted_agent_*` | What the roles allow, compiled from `allowed_services`, `allowed_targets` and `allowed_agents`. [Authorization](../authorization/) describes them. |

The node does not set any of these facts. Roles come from the bindings in
the mesh policy, not from the identity provider: an issuer's `roles` claim
is stored as `idp_role()`, which grants nothing by itself. Labels are the
ones the node asked for and the policy allowed. Grants come from the policy.

Tokens carry no appended blocks. Biscuit lets a holder attenuate a token by
appending blocks, but SAM verifiers reject any token that has one. A request
that needs to carry an extra claim (for example, which agent a node is acting
for) sends it next to the token instead.

## Lifetime and refresh

A credential is valid for `--biscuit-ttl`, 24 hours by default. If the OIDC
token expires sooner, the credential expires with it. Nodes and routers check
every ten minutes, and when less than a fifth of the lifetime remains they
call `POST /refresh` with the current token and a signature over a fresh
challenge. The control plane verifies both, resolves the identity's roles
against the current policy again, and mints a new token with the same
identity facts and labels.

Refresh is limited by the **session**, which is a record on the control
plane, not a field in the token. The session of an OIDC enrollment lasts
`--oidc-session-ttl`, 90 days by default. After that, the node has to log in
again. A bootstrap enrollment has no session expiry. A ban also acts on the
session record.

A node that enrolled interactively with `--offline-access` also keeps an OIDC
refresh token. If its credential expires completely, it uses the refresh
token to obtain a new ID token and re-enrolls under the same peer ID without
any user action.

## Signing keys and rotation

The control plane rotates its signing key every `--key-rotation-interval`
(24 hours by default). The previous key stays valid for `--key-grace-period`
(1 hour by default) and is then retired. `GET /keys` returns the current set
of keys, signed by each key in the set. Routers poll it every
`--keys-sync-interval`; nodes fetch it at enrollment and then every
`--control-plane-sync-interval`, together with the ban set and the mesh
policy. A rotation event only brings the next pull forward. Both accept a
new set only if one of its signatures verifies under a key they already
trust. The first key comes from enrollment, and each later key is vouched
for by the key it replaces.

Nobody can verify a credential signed by a retired key, including the
control plane. A node that was offline for a whole grace period therefore
cannot refresh. This is intentional. The grace period is the deadline after
which a machine that went quiet cannot come back unnoticed. How it comes back
depends on how it enrolled:

- An OIDC node with a refresh token re-enrolls on its own.
- A bootstrap node needs an operator to mint a new token and run
  `sam-node join` again (or to restart the router with the new token). The
  node keeps its peer ID. The control plane recognises the approved peer and
  mints a new credential without going through the approval queue.
- A bootstrap node whose record has `autonomous_recovery` set may refresh on
  proof of possession of its key alone. This is off by default, and an
  administrator sets it per token or per node. A node that can always
  recover holds a credential that never expires, and only a ban stops it.

## Revocation

`POST /admin/revoke` with a peer ID (or `sam-one admin ban`, or the console)
marks the node as banned. Its next refresh is refused and the node daemon
exits. The control plane publishes the peer ID in `/info`, which routers and
nodes read, so peers stop accepting connections from it before its current
token expires. If the node was enrolled through OIDC, the identity behind it
(`issuer|subject`) is banned too. It can no longer register a new key, and
bootstrap tokens it minted stop working. `POST /admin/nodes/{peer_id}/unban`
reverses both bans.

A bootstrap token can be revoked before it expires with
`DELETE /admin/bootstrap-tokens/{id}`. The token stays in the list, marked
as revoked, so the record of what it enrolled is kept.

## What a node proves on every connection

The control plane's HTTP API is protected by challenge signatures, because a
peer ID in a request body is otherwise only a claim. On the mesh, the libp2p
secure channel already proves which key is on the other end, so the handshake
between two nodes is simpler. Each side sends its credential. Each side
verifies the other's signature and expiry, checks that the credential's
`node()` fact matches the authenticated peer, and checks the ban list. Only
then is the requested service name evaluated against policy. Routers perform
the same handshake on every connection they accept, so a banned or unenrolled
peer cannot reach the DHT.
